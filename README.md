# AutomatedImageEvaluation
# BY Jiangkun Liu
This project automatically evaluate CT images, in terms of noise, CNR, spatial resolution.
The algorithm first detects target objects, including simulated turor, water section, calcification, then calculates contrast to noise ration,
noise level, background uniformity, etc.

The project also comes with an image viewer, which allows visual perception of the images, as well as demonstrates the visibility of calcifications.
